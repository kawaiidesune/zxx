# zxx
The ZXX typeface. The site it was on, z-x-x.org, is dead. It appears cybersquatters are redirecting the domain name to some kind of browser-based spyware plugin. It now resides on [GitHub](https://github.com/kawaiidesune/zxx) and at [zxx.vero.moe](https://zxx.vero.moe). This readme was adapted from the Read Me.rtf file originally included with the font.
